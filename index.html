             <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> I'm just a girl, who has a very complicated relationship with coding sometimes I hate it and sometimes I kind of like it.</p>
            <p> I'm a student who's not passionate about anything but software development seems interesting and fun. I hope to learn more interesting things.</p>

             <h3> Latest Project </h3>
             <p> The project that I worked on recently is called res_me. It gathers all the available residents around a university and depending on the user preference, the recommended residences will be shown with all the contact details which a user can choose from. </p>
